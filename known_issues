SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T HIT AN ENEMY FROM A CERTAIN DIRECTION. MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY DOORLIKE ISSUE

THE PLAYER CAN ATTACK HIMSELF VIA QUICKLY CHANGING POSITIONS

Inventory having too many items leads to overflow via going above the amount of available chars

Repeatedly using Confusion Scroll on enemies can negate(?) status effect or doesn't stack

You can apply status components to items by targeting them on the ground when using a status scroll (keep this and enhance this into a mechanic?)

<!WARNING!> WHEN CREATING SOMETHING IN RAWs ALWAYS PUT IT IN THE CORRECT CATEGORY (e.g, items[], monsters[])

<!WARNING!> ENTITIES AND INVENTORIES ARE NOT SAVED IN savegame.json UNLESS YOU MODIFY THE RETURN ENTITY BUILDER IN rawmaster.rs TO HAVE THE <Serializeme> COMPONENT

By swapping with a bystander, you can end up inside walls

Bystanders will move into the same tile as you. Because we don't want to forcibly switch the player, this is an AI issue

Log isn't cleared when you die

Possible that deer can get hit from x+1 y+1 of where the Player/Wolf is attacking. Could be due to lag, where deer moves immediately after being attacked but the particle lingers

Deep ocean tiles are rendered grey out of sight (shouldn't be rendered at all)
