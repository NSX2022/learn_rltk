    In order of priority/ease of implementation
    
-Keep fleshing out the config

-Ensure doors don't spawn adjacent to each other
   
-Give enemies varying health, e.g +1 to -1 for kobolds and goblins, +2 to -1 for orcs

-Inventory pages e.g, Scrolls->Equippable->Potions->Quest Items->Misc, or just a page for every 36 items (fixes inventory overflow glitch)

-Weapons with random attributes and damage

-Save to .dat instead of .json

-Add damage types e.g, blunt/slashing/piercing, lightning, fire, magic, etc.

-Add more possible entity components e.g, Undead, Summoner, Cowardly, Mindless (can't be confused), etc.

-Create unique floors down to at least 20

-Open world (pipe dream)
