Inventory having too many items leads to overflow via going above the amount of available chars, fix by implementing inventory pages

Repeatedly using Confusion Scroll on enemies can negate(?) status effect

You can apply statuses to items by targeting them on the ground when using a status scroll (keep this and enhance this into a mechanic?)

If there is an entity overlapping an item, the descriptor when hovering mouse on it is missing first char on entity name

!WARNING! WHEN CREATING SOMETHING IN RAWs ALWAYS PUT IT IN THE CORRECT CATEGORY (e.g, items[], monsters[])

Convert saving and loading to binary

Waveform collapse builder starts you at 0 depth where every other builder starts you at the appropriate depth level

!WARNING! ENTITIES AND INVENTORIES ARE NOT SAVED IN savegame.json UNLESS YOU MODIFY THE RETURN ENTITY BUILDER IN rawmaster.rs TO HAVE <Serializeme> COMPONENT
