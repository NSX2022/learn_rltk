Inventory having too many items leads to overflow via going above the amount of available chars

Repeatedly using Confusion Scroll on enemies can negate(?) status effect

You can apply statuses to items by targeting them on the ground when using a status scroll (keep this and enhance this into a mechanic?)

When there is no save, Load Game is hidden (good) but is still selectable

If there is an entity overlapping an item, the descriptor when hovering mouse on it is missing first char on entity name

WHEN CREATING SOMETHING IN RAWs ALWAYS PUT IT IN THE CORRECT CATEGORY (e.g, items[], monsters[])
